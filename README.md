# Hi, there!
I'm Timothy from the Netherlands, and recently I started learning webdevelopment. The combination between design(UI/UX) really interests me. To learn all these amazing things I follow online tutorials and courses. That's how I accuired knowledge about HTML and CSS. Now it's time for the next step: Javascript. 
On here I will keep adding all the things I learned and made! 
Please contact me if you have advice, or inspiring ideas. 

Thanks!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really like the color yellow!
