### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Timothy from the Netherlands, and recently I started learning webdevelopment. Through online tutorials and courses I learned HTML and CSS. Currently I'm taking the step in SCSS and Javascript. What really interests me is the combination between design (UX/UI) and development. I will keep my profile up-to-date with the things I learned and discovered.
